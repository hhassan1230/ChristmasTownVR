## Tech Stack
- [React 360](https://github.com/facebookarchive/react-360) - This app was developed using the [React 360](https://github.com/facebookarchive/react-360) framework. We implemented components with React and React Native, and the Web experience was provided by React 360
- ReactJS - A deep understanding of the ReactJS framework was used in this applications. The mix of ReactJS and JavaScript allowed much of the calculations, data Structure usage, modern syntax.
- JavaScript - Many of the funtionalities needed a deep understanding of JavaScript. 
Experience was provided with React 360. 

MadeInBrooklynGames was dedicated to developing this experience with literally no experience in React 360, neither the time to sit and code. This experience was really limited
React 360 is a framework with limited resources. Many functionalities were left out as there are not a lot of people that know React 360 and there was literally no one to answer our questions. The main challenges came during platform compatibility as the browser on the desktop is not the same as on a mobile device. There was a lot of 
debugging with nowhere to go, BUT, we made it through and excited to present this fantastic experience.
